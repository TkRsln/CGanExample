# CGanExample
The main goal of the project is to imitate human handwriting using the "Conditional Generative Adversarial Network" model.
-The model is trained using the well-known "MINST" dataset.
-While the model is being trained, it takes the value of the "Label", that is, the number to be written, as Input, and also receives a noise value.
-In this way, Artificial Intelligence gains the ability to generate numbers with a text style that is not in the dataset.
